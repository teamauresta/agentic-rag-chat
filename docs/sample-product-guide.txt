DataFlow Platform — Product Guide

Overview
DataFlow is Acme Corp's flagship data integration platform. It connects disparate data sources, transforms data in real-time, and delivers clean, structured datasets to downstream consumers.

Key Features
- Real-time streaming ingestion from 50+ source connectors (databases, APIs, message queues)
- Visual pipeline builder with drag-and-drop transformation nodes
- Built-in data quality checks: schema validation, null detection, anomaly scoring
- Horizontal scaling — handles 100K+ events/second on modest hardware
- Full audit trail and lineage tracking for compliance requirements

Architecture
DataFlow runs as a set of microservices deployed via Docker or Kubernetes:
1. Ingestion Service — manages source connections and data capture
2. Transform Engine — applies user-defined transformations (SQL, Python, or visual)
3. Quality Gate — validates data against defined rules before delivery
4. Delivery Service — pushes data to destinations (data warehouses, lakes, APIs)
5. Control Plane — web UI for pipeline management, monitoring, and alerting

System Requirements
- CPU: 4+ cores (8 recommended for production)
- RAM: 16GB minimum, 32GB recommended
- Storage: 100GB SSD for metadata and buffering
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+, RHEL 8+), or Docker
- Database: PostgreSQL 14+ for metadata storage
